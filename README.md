# Mission_to_Mars

The purpose of this analysis is to help Robin add more polish to her web app. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, and a web application used to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
Sample images generated as results of analysis are as follows:
